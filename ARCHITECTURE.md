# Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of the frontend application, its boundaries, and the operational contracts it must uphold.

## Frontend Boundary

The frontend is a single-page application responsible for:

- Rendering user-visible status derived from authoritative backend sources.
- Managing client-side routing, data fetching, caching, and offline behavior.
- Enforcing client-side performance and resource budgets.

Backend APIs, persisted data, and chain state remain authoritative. The frontend never invents financial values or chain state; it only reflects them.

## Routing

Routes are declared centrally and each route is associated with a lazy-loaded module boundary. Route transitions must remain compatible with existing deep links and persisted navigation state.

## Route-Level Performance Budgets

To keep the application responsive and to catch regressions early, each route declares an explicit performance budget. Budgets are validated at runtime and reported through structured diagnostics.

### Budget Dimensions

- **Load time**: maximum time from route navigation start to the route's first meaningful render.
- **Render time**: maximum time for the route's initial render commit.
- **Bundle size**: maximum transferred JavaScript size attributable to the route's lazy chunk.

### Thresholds

Thresholds are defined per route and are intentionally conservative. A route without an explicit budget inherits the default budget. Budgets are validated to be positive, finite numbers; invalid budgets are rejected and fall back to the default rather than disabling enforcement.

### Enforcement and Bounded Resource Usage

- Measurement uses the browser Performance API when available and degrades gracefully when it is not.
- Observers are bounded: a single performance observer per route, disconnected after the route settles, to avoid unbounded listener growth.
- Budget checks are non-blocking and never delay rendering or navigation.

### Failure and Diagnostics

- A budget violation emits a structured error event containing the route, the dimension, the observed value, and the configured threshold.
- Violations are reported as metrics so they can be aggregated and alerted on in production.
- Missing or unsupported performance APIs are treated as a non-fatal condition and reported as a diagnostic, not an error.

### Compatibility and Rollback

- Budget enforcement is observational only; it does not alter routing, rendering, or user-visible status.
- Budgets can be relaxed or disabled per route without changing route behavior, providing a safe rollback path.
- Existing routes, deep links, and persisted navigation state remain fully compatible.

## Offline Support

Offline state is tracked centrally and surfaced through a banner. Data fetching uses a unified query key scheme so cached data remains consistent across hooks and components.

## Deferred Wallet SDK Loading

The wallet SDK is loaded lazily to keep the initial bundle small and to avoid blocking first paint. Route-level budgets account for the deferred load so that wallet-dependent routes still meet their thresholds.

## Observability

- Structured errors are emitted for budget violations and dependency failures.
- Metrics are recorded for route load, render, and bundle dimensions.
- Operational diagnostics distinguish between unsupported environments and genuine regressions.

## Testing

Focused automated tests cover success, boundary values, invalid configuration, unsupported environments, and dependency failure paths for route budgets, alongside existing routing and offline tests.
